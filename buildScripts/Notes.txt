Servers
- Express
  (Lightwieght, highly configurable, not just for static files, production ready. Great for not)
  Competitors
  - Koa
  - Hapi
  All good for serverside node apps.

- Webpack (comes with inbuilt server)
- http-server (Simpliest, Lightweight .. no config)
- live-server (Lightweight ... live reloading)
- browsersync

Your decision for server may also be dependent on your bundler as they often come with their own server or
with support for particular servers. Budo is great to browserify (includes hot reloading)
Webpack comes with its own webserver. Serves app from memory

- Browsersync: free webserver. Sets up dedicated IP on LAN. Can sync all changes across varios access point.
great for cross browser testing.

Sharing Work In progress

- localtunnel (easiest install. punches hole through firewall to expose local machine port. Ultra versatile)
- ngrok (requires a few extra steps to sort. ngrok is more secure. Password protection)
- now (publishes up to an actual web server, deploys up to the cloud. Does not punch hole in firework. Only host static files)
- surge (supoort only static html and js)


Using localtunnel

- npm install localtunnel -g (install globally)
- lt --port 3000 --subdomain ogisi (subdomain optional but creates better urls)


Automation

- Grunt (configuration driven, less code)
- Gulp (using pipe, does not write to disc. Code based, write code)
- npm
